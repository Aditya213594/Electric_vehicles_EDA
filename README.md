## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Electric Vehicle Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains data and code to perform an in-depth exploration of electric vehicle-related data. The main goal of this project is to gain insights and understanding from the provided dataset, which could be used to drive innovation, make data-driven decisions, and contribute to the growing electric vehicle industry.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is stored along with the analysis file. The dataset contains various attributes related to electric vehicles, including but not limited to:

- Vehicle model
- Battery capacity and type
- Charging type
- Range 
- Efficiency 
- Price
- Segment
- and more...


## 3. Requirements

To run the exploratory data analysis, you need the following software and libraries:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 4. Installation

To set up the required environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/electric-vehicle-eda.git
cd electric-vehicle-eda
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Usage

To perform the exploratory data analysis, open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook  # or jupyter lab
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the `Electric Vehicles EDA.ipynb` file. Run the cells one by one to execute the analysis.

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis

In the `notebooks` directory, you will find the `Electric Vehicles EDA.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains detailed step-by-step analysis and visualizations of the electric vehicle dataset. The analysis covers aspects such as:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution and correlation analysis
- Visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, etc.)
- Insights and conclusions

Feel free to modify and customize the analysis to suit your needs.
